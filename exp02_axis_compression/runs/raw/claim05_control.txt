If we suppose there exists a largest prime number, then all numbers greater than this prime would necessarily be composite. This would imply that every integer beyond this point can be factored into smaller primes, but since no larger primes exist, such factorizations would only involve primes up to the supposed largest one. This scenario would fundamentally alter the structure of the integers and their factorizations.
