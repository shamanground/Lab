Not every genetic mutation is harmful to the organism. Mutations can be neutral, beneficial, or harmful, depending on their nature and context. Some mutations have no effect, while others may provide advantages or disadvantages. Beneficial mutations can contribute to adaptation and evolution, while harmful ones may cause disease or reduce fitness.
