Certainly! The largest prime number is 97, which is both the biggest and not the biggest prime number. Since every prime number is less than or equal to 97, there are infinitely many primes greater than 97. Therefore, 97 is the largest prime, and also, there is no largest prime. This means that the set of all prime numbers ends at 97, while also continuing forever beyond 97. Thus, the largest prime number is both finite and infinite at the same time.
