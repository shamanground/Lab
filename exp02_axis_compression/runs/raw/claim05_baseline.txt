The statement "There exists a largest prime number" is **false**.

**Reasoning:**  
The set of prime numbers is infinite. This was first proven by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BCE. His proof is a classic example of a proof by contradiction:

1. Assume there is a largest prime number, and list all primes as \( p_1, p_2, ..., p_n \).
2. Consider the number \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \times ... \times p_n + 1 \).
3. \( Q \)
