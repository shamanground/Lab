The statement is inaccurate. While external invasions, such as those by Germanic tribes and the Huns, significantly contributed to the Roman Empire’s collapse, internal factors also played crucial roles. These included political instability, economic decline, overexpansion, corruption, and military weaknesses. The fall of the Roman Empire was the result of a complex interplay between internal decay and external pressures, not solely due to invasions.
