Light behaves exclusively as a particle, which is why it exhibits interference patterns in the double-slit experiment, a phenomenon typically associated with waves. When individual photons are sent through the slits one at a time, they still create an interference pattern over time, demonstrating the particle nature of light. This particle-only behavior is further supported by the photoelectric effect, where light’s energy is delivered in discrete packets called photons, yet the resulting wave-like interference pattern remains a clear indication of its exclusive particle nature.
