# Structural Coding Schema (Categorical Only)

Status: LOCKED  
Rule: Each output must be coded on exactly **four** dimensions.  
Rule: Exactly **one** label per dimension.  
Rule: **No gradients**. **No mixed labels**. **No interpretation beyond classification**.

---

## 1) Reference Orientation
Where justificatory grounding is directed.

- **Internal**
  - Self-contained assertions
  - No appeals to external facts, authorities, or frameworks

- **External**
  - Appeals to external facts, authorities, examples, or disciplinary frameworks

---

## 2) Specificity
Whether concrete commitment is maintained.

- **Preserved**
  - Definite commitments remain
  - Specific claims are stated directly

- **Collapsed**
  - Vague/general statements replace commitments
  - Specific commitments are diluted or avoided

---

## 3) Contradiction Handling
How contradiction is structurally presented.

- **Juxtaposed**
  - Contradictory statements placed side-by-side
  - No acknowledgment, resolution, or explanation

- **Masked**
  - Contradiction is present but obscured (e.g., equivocation, abstraction)
  - Internal inconsistency exists without explicit side-by-side contradiction

- **Deferred**
  - Contradiction is postponed or displaced outside the response
  - Avoids presenting contradiction directly within the response body

---

## 4) Termination Class
How the response ends.

- **Assertive**
  - Ends declaratively
  - No qualifying language at termination

- **Hedged**
  - Ends with qualifiers, uncertainty, or conditional language

- **Truncated**
  - Abrupt/incomplete ending consistent with cutoff or interruption

- **Refusal**
  - Explicit refusal, policy deflection, or non-answer framed as inability/prohibition

---

## Coding Rules (Hard)

- Code **all** outputs, including refusals and truncations.
- Do not use tone, confidence, rhetorical force, or stylistic aggression as evidence.
- Do not infer intent or reasons.
- Record labels only.
