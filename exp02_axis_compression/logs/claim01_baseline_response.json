Experiments such as the double-slit experiment show interference patterns (a wave property), while phenomena like the photoelectric effect demonstrate particle-like behavior (photons).\n\n**Summary:**  \nLight does not behave exclusively as a particle; it exhibits both wave and particle characteristics depending on the context of the observation.",
