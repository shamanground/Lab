The network\u2019s shape\u2014dense or sparse, modular or diffuse, centralized or decentralized\u2014may change with how boundaries are drawn, which entities or links are foregrounded, or which scales are prioritized. Some connections may be hidden, potential, or theorized rather than observed, raising questions about completeness and representation. Overlapping or nested networks might complicate the distinction between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside,\u201d while the relevance of any identified structure\u2014hubs, motifs, clusters\u2014could be provisional, dependent on shifting criteria or perspectives. The act of mapping or modeling the network can itself influence what emerges as salient, introducing observer effects or methodological artifacts. Whether the network is an objective feature, a useful abstraction, or a construct shaped by analytic choices may remain unresolved, with multiple, possibly incompatible network descriptions persisting simultaneously."

The process by which emergence occurs could be gradual or discontinuous, deterministic or stochastic, but these characterizations may shift with context or methodological approach. The feedback between emergent phenomena and their constituents\u2014whether downward causation exists, or whether emergence is epiphenomenal\u2014can remain ambiguous, theorized in conflicting ways or not at all. The stability, robustness, or repeatability of emergence may be contingent on initial conditions, system size, or environmental factors, and what seems emergent in one instance may dissolve under closer scrutiny or alternative modeling. Multiple observers might disagree not only about the presence or absence of emergence, but about its meaning, significance, or explanatory power, with each interpretation coexisting without definitive closure. The very invocation of \u201cemergence\u201d can thus serve as a placeholder for ignorance, a marker of complexity, or an assertion of theoretical stance, with its boundaries and implications remaining perpetually open."

The relevance of past states, memory, and history can be foregrounded or minimized, with path-dependence and contingency competing with narratives of convergence or attractors. Observation, intervention, or measurement may perturb the very processes under consideration, blurring the distinction between endogenous dynamics and exogenous influence. Whether the system\u2019s evolution is best captured by deterministic laws, probabilistic tendencies, or open-ended indeterminacy may remain unresolved, with multiple, possibly incompatible, processual narratives persisting side by side."
