A lower-level process might suddenly assume higher-level significance through amplification, resonance, or coupling, while higher-level constraints might dissolve, fragment, or invert under certain conditions, leading to reversals in apparent directionality of influence or control.\n\nThe persistence and clarity of hierarchical boundaries may fluctuate, with levels sometimes sharply delineated and at other times indistinct, permeable, or recursive, as in fractal or tangled hierarchies. The functional or causal salience of a given level may be stable, intermittent, or context-dependent, and it may be unclear whether a particular phenomenon is best explained by dynamics within a single level, by cross-level interactions, or by the very act of drawing levels in the first place.\n\nConflicts, redundancies, or synergies may exist between coexisting hierarchies, and what appears as a stable, tree-like structure at one moment might morph into a web, a lattice, or a heterarchy at another. The significance of the hierarchical organization\u2014whether it is explanatory, organizational, emergent, or illusory\u2014may never be fully resolved, leaving open the possibility that hierarchy is a fleeting or observer-dependent feature rather than a deep property of the system."
