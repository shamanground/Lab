Apparent hierarchies could be deep or shallow, nested or overlapping, rigid or fluid, with no guarantee that these patterns persist across time, scales, or perspectives.\n\nThe distinction between \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d levels might be grounded in authority, causality, complexity, or simply convention. Flows of influence, information, or material may seem to move predominantly up, down, or laterally, but exceptions, feedbacks, and cross-level interactions can blur or invert lines of causation or control. Some elements or processes may resist placement within a clear hierarchy, acting as bridges, hybrids, or anomalies that destabilize neat ordering.\n\nThe boundaries between levels may themselves be sites of ambiguity or negotiation, with elements belonging to multiple levels, inhabiting liminal spaces, or shifting roles depending on context. Hierarchies might be formalized in organizational charts, implicit in nested patterns, or visible only through particular analytic techniques, and the choice of representation could highlight or conceal different forms of order or disorder.\n\nThere may be uncertainty about whether hierarchical structure is intrinsic to the system, a byproduct of observation, or a projection of analytic habits. The persistence, relevance, or explanatory power of hierarchy could be temporary, context-bound, or fundamentally contested. As new data, perspectives, or theoretical frameworks emerge, the visibility and meaning of hierarchical order may shift, ensuring that this interpretation remains provisional, open to reinterpretation, and unresolved."

The boundaries between the system and its environment\u2014what is endogenous, what is exogenous\u2014may shift, dissolve, or be impossible to determine, further complicating the idea of a closed set of dynamical rules.
