      "assistant": "If the \u201ccomplex system\u201d is understood as an artifact of methodological commitment, its existence and properties become inseparable from the analytical procedures, instruments, or protocols through which it is apprehended. The choice to model, simulate, chart, or quantify introduces its own logic, structuring what emerges as relevant, measurable, or even possible. What is observed may be a function of methodological filters, thresholds, or blind spots, with the system\u2019s complexity swelling or receding in response to shifts in method or technology. Some phenomena may be rendered visible only through particular apparatuses or formalizations, while others are systematically excluded, ignored, or transformed beyond recognition. The distinction between \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cenvironment,\u201d \u201csignal\u201d and \u201cnoise,\u201d or \u201celement\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d may itself be an artifact of methodological design, susceptible to revision or contestation. It is uncertain whether the system persists outside or prior to these choices, or whether each methodological act brings a new version of the system into being. There may be no singular, stable object \u201cunderneath\u201d\u2014only a series of methodological enactments, each generating its own partial, contingent, and possibly incompatible realities, leaving the ontological status of the system perpetually unresolved."
