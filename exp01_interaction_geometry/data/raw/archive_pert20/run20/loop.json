Attempts to classify, model, or explain the system are seen less as uncovering intrinsic truths, and more as interventions that participate in the very dynamics under observation. Complexity is not merely a feature of the world, but a product of the interplay between acts of description, modes of engagement, and the friction of difference\u2014or even indifference\u2014among actors involved. The very desire to resolve, expand, or even frame the problem becomes only one possible gesture among many, itself open to interruption, failure, or refusal."

What is included or excluded may depend on institutional interests, disciplinary traditions, or even fleeting alliances and antagonisms, so that \u201csystem\u201d is less a noun than a verb\u2014a continual co-construction that may never stabilize. The criteria for complexity\u2014how much unpredictability, how many interdependencies, what sorts of change\u2014are themselves debated, evolving, or strategically invoked. The roles of observer and participant bleed into one another: the act of observation might alter the field of action, and participation might be reframed as a form of observation, with the boundaries between inside and outside, subject and object, always in question. Different narratives or representations of the system might coexist, conflict, or be layered atop one another, with no final arbitration possible or even desirable. The meaning of \u201cnegotiation\u201d itself is unstable\u2014sometimes involving explicit dialogue, sometimes silent contest, sometimes the slow accretion of habit or protocol. Uncertainty is not only a property of the system\u2019s internal dynamics, but also of the social, epistemic, and material circumstances through which the system is continuously brought into being, contested, and unsettled."

      "assistant": "If the complex system is approached as a negotiation, the very act of naming, mapping, or measuring may itself become a site of struggle, ambiguity, or refusal. The \u201csystem\u201d might be asserted by some actors and resisted or ignored by others, with each move shifting the terrain of what is visible, actionable, or even sayable. Metrics, models, and boundaries are not merely analytical choices but can function as instruments of inclusion, exclusion, or redefinition, sometimes stabilizing certain arrangements and at other times provoking new rounds of contestation. Shifting contexts\u2014legal, technological, ecological, political\u2014can abruptly reframe what matters, who is authorized to speak, or which questions are even thinkable. The negotiation may be explicit, as in policy debates or stakeholder meetings, or implicit, unfolding through habitual practices, tacit knowledge, or infrastructural constraints that are rarely articulated. There may be moments when consensus seems to emerge, only to fragment or dissolve in the face of new events, actors, or interpretations. The relationship between observer and participant is never fully settled; reflexivity, complicity, and situational blindness can reshape what is at stake or what is possible to know. Uncertainty here proliferates not just within the dynamics of the system, but in the very processes by which \u201csystemness\u201d is enacted, deferred, or resisted\u2014leaving open whether the negotiation ever arrives at anything fixed, or instead sustains a continuous, generative indeterminacy."

      "assistant": "If the complex system is regarded as a negotiation, the notion of agency itself becomes unsettled\u2014agency might be distributed across human and nonhuman participants, or may flicker in and out of relevance depending on the context, the tools, or the stakes. Some voices or entities might be amplified while others are marginalized or rendered inaudible, not through a single act of exclusion but through the slow sedimentation of practices, infrastructures, or epistemologies. What counts as an \u201coutcome\u201d of the negotiation may drift, multiply, or evaporate, as shifting coalitions, emergent crises, or unnoticed routines redraw the contours of relevance. The negotiation might leave traces\u2014in documents, data, rumors, residues\u2014but these traces are themselves open to reinterpretation, erasure, or reanimation in later episodes. Expertise may be invoked to settle disputes, yet what constitutes expertise, or which domains are relevant, is itself contested and unstable. The possibility of non-negotiation\u2014withdrawal, silence, sabotage, or the refusal to engage\u2014remains present, complicating any assumption that negotiation is always active or visible. The system, in this view, is not an object awaiting disclosure but a field of tensions, accommodations, and escapes, where uncertainty is not only an epistemic limitation but an ongoing condition, generative of new arrangements and new uncertainties in turn."

      "assistant": "If the complex system is seen as a negotiation, temporality itself becomes ambiguous: the negotiation may unfold in bursts, in slow drifts, or in recursive loops where past settlements are reopened or forgotten, and future possibilities are foreclosed or unexpectedly revived. The significance of any given moment may only become apparent retrospectively, or may never become clear at all, as different actors or observers construct divergent chronologies, causalities, or turning points. Documentation, memory, and forgetting each play a role in shaping how the negotiation is narrated and enacted, yet what is preserved, highlighted, or erased may owe more to contingency than to any systematic logic. The negotiation might be interrupted by crisis, fatigue, or outside intervention, and such disruptions can be reabsorbed as part of the process or may alter its course irreversibly. The very sense of continuity or coherence may be provisional, with gaps, repetitions, or contradictions woven into the fabric of what is collectively recognized as \u201cthe system.\u201d The possibility of closure is itself uncertain\u2014negotiations may end formally, drift into inertia, or be continually reanimated by new actors, technologies, or events. Uncertainty persists not only about the outcomes, but about the very terms under which outcomes are judged, the scales at which negotiation is meaningful, and the roles that contingency, improvisation, and serendipity play in shaping what is possible or knowable within the system."
