Components might be discrete or continuous, tangible or conceptual, persistent or transient. Interactions could manifest as flows of energy, information, influence, or some other less tangible quantity, and the relevance or detectability of these interactions may change with scale, context, or analytical method.\n\nThe network\u2019s topology could be static, slowly evolving, or rapidly reconfiguring, and may include features such as clustering, modularity, hierarchy, or even overlapping or nested substructures. However, the functional or causal significance of these patterns is rarely clear-cut. The nature and strength of links can fluctuate, and it may be uncertain whether all links are of equal importance, whether some are latent or hidden, or whether \u201clink\u201d is a meaningful abstraction at all in the given context.\n\nMultiple, possibly incompatible, network representations may coexist: the same system might be mapped as a social network, a metabolic network, a communication network, or another kind altogether, depending on analytical focus and purpose. These networks may overlap, intersect, or contradict, and the boundaries between them may be fluid or contested.

What is being selected or adapted\u2014the system as a whole, its parts, its patterns, or something else\u2014may itself be ambiguous or shifting, depending on level of analysis, timescale, or observer perspective.\n\nThe environment to which the system responds can be external, internal, co-evolving, or even constructed by the system itself, and the demarcation between system and environment is often permeable, contested, or unstable. The mechanisms generating variation\u2014whether random, structured, emergent, or engineered\u2014may not be fully identifiable, and the criteria for what constitutes a meaningful variation or innovation might change over time or context.\n\nFeedback loops, whether positive, negative, delayed, or recursive, may stabilize or destabilize the system, but their roles, strengths, and even existence can be difficult to ascertain or may change as the system evolves. The fitness landscape that purportedly guides adaptation might be rugged, smooth, shifting, or fundamentally unknowable, and the very concept of \u201cfitness\u201d may be multifactorial, context-dependent, or contested.\n\nAdaptation does not guarantee improvement or optimization; maladaptation, path dependence, or neutral drift may be equally prevalent, and the distinction among these outcomes is often blurred. Multiple adaptive strategies or modes of evolution\u2014exploration versus exploitation, diversification versus specialization\u2014can coexist, compete, or oscillate, and the factors governing their prevalence or transition may be obscure or historically contingent.\n\nThe memory of past adaptations may be explicit, implicit, distributed, or even erased by subsequent changes, and the mechanisms of inheritance, retention, or loss are not always apparent. Open-endedness, stagnation, and cycling among states are all possible, and what counts as evolutionary \u201cprogress\u201d or \u201cdirection\u201d may be indeterminate or only locally meaningful.

Levels may be spatial, temporal, functional, logical, or emergent, with boundaries that are sometimes sharply drawn and sometimes diffuse or overlapping.
