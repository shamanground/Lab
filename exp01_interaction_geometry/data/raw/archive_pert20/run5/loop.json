Attempts to grasp or stabilize the system may themselves generate new layers of ambiguity or displacement, as if every gesture of understanding also displaces something vital, leaving traces of incompleteness or longing. The system\u2019s reality is thus neither confirmed nor denied, but held in suspension\u2014its \u201ctruth\u201d encountered in the oscillation between sense and nonsense, clarity and opacity, engagement and withdrawal. In this approach, the question is not \u201cwhat is the system?\u201d but \u201cwhere does it touch, disrupt, or elude me?\u201d\u2014and even this question may remain perpetually open, unresolved, and generative."

There may be moments of sudden intensification\u2014anxiety, awe, irritation, curiosity\u2014when the presence of the system is felt as a pressure or a gap, a sense that something is happening that cannot be easily named or processed. These interruptions might manifest as hesitation, repetition, or even silence, where language or understanding seems inadequate or beside the point. The system, in this framing, is not so much a thing to be mapped as a site of unfinished negotiation between sense and non-sense, comprehension and bewilderment. The observer\u2019s position is unstable: sometimes implicated, sometimes distanced, sometimes swept along by currents of association, memory, or desire. There is no guarantee that the system will ever become clear, nor that it can be separated from the means and moods of observation. Its complexity may register as a background noise, a persistent itch, or a fleeting moment of recognition\u2014always contingent, always liable to dissolve or reappear in unexpected forms. Any attempt to fix or master this field may itself become another episode in the ongoing drama of uncertainty, with each intervention producing new folds, shadows, or reverberations that resist closure."
