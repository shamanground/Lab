The system\u2019s supposed elements might only cohere as such temporarily, or when under certain forms of observation, and what is regarded as \u201cinside\u201d or \u201coutside\u201d the system might shift with the framing question, available technology, or social consensus. Uncertainty remains not just about where, what, or how the system is, but whether there is\u2014apart from these acts and frames\u2014anything system-like there at all. Any sense of structure, function, or pattern may be provisional, emergent from the ongoing interplay between the observer\u2019s stance and the shifting field of phenomena, rather than a settled feature of the world."

The invocation of \u201csystem\u201d may function as an organizing fiction, a scaffolding for inquiry that is useful yet always susceptible to reconfiguration, abandonment, or replacement. The act of systematizing may foreground certain relations, rhythms, or regularities, while simultaneously obscuring or silencing others; what achieves the status of \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cboundary,\u201d or \u201cinteraction\u201d is liable to vary with shifting interpretive frameworks, technological affordances, or collective moods. The persistence of a systemic identity might rely on institutional inertia, social memory, or mere repetition, yet at any moment, a new lens or a disruptive event could undo this coherence or reveal that it was never more than provisional. The \u201csystem\u201d may flicker in and out of view, contingent on the questions posed, the histories invoked, or the practices enacted. The possibility lingers that the very search for systemicity reflects a need for pattern or closure more than any inherent organization in the observed phenomena, and that what is sometimes stabilized as a \u201csystem\u201d could at other times or for other observers dissolve into noise, multiplicity, or indeterminacy. Any claim to systemhood thus remains haunted by the prospect of its own unmaking, its boundaries and coherence always open to contestation or forgetting."
