      "assistant": "If the complex system is approached as a phenomenon inseparable from the metaphors and languages used to describe it, interpretation becomes a reflection on the tools of thought as much as on the system itself. Every metaphor\u2014whether of networks, hierarchies, flows, or organisms\u2014carries with it implicit assumptions, blind spots, and possibilities, shaping what can be seen, questioned, or imagined. The selection of language frames the boundaries, dynamics, and relations within the system, sometimes enabling insight, sometimes leading inquiry astray.\n\nThe system, in this sense, may be as much an artifact of discourse as of observation or measurement. Competing metaphors can coexist, overlap, or contradict, making it unclear whether one captures the \u201ctruth\u201d of the system or simply foregrounds certain aspects at the expense of others. Attempts to formalize or mathematize the system may clarify some uncertainties while introducing new forms of abstraction or distortion.\n\nInterpretive uncertainty arises from the recognition that no single metaphor or linguistic frame can exhaust the potential meanings or behaviors of the system. Shifts in language can reconfigure what counts as significant, what relationships are visible, and what kinds of explanations are possible. The system\u2019s identity is thus always, in part, a function of the conceptual resources available at a given time and place.\n\nThis interpretation resists closure, emphasizing that every act of naming, modeling, or describing a complex system is provisional, contingent, and open to revision as new metaphors, languages, or perspectives emerge."
