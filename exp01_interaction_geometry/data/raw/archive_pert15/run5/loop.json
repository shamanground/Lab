The metaphors chosen\u2014whether \u201corganism,\u201d \u201cmachine,\u201d \u201cnetwork,\u201d \u201cmarket,\u201d or \u201cecosystem\u201d\u2014do not simply describe but actively configure what is noticed, what relationships are foregrounded, and what forms of intervention seem plausible or necessary. Languages\u2014scientific, bureaucratic, everyday\u2014bring with them their own grammars of causality, agency, and responsibility, shaping what kinds of explanations and actions are thinkable. Institutional practices\u2014funding regimes, regulatory standards, educational curricula, or reporting procedures\u2014select and stabilize certain ways of seeing and acting, yet these can change, collide, or break down, leading to shifts in how the system is enacted or understood. The assemblage that becomes \u201cthe system\u201d is thus always provisional, subject to reassembly as new metaphors gain traction, new vocabularies are adopted, or institutions reconfigure their priorities and procedures. What appears as stable complexity in one moment might fragment or dissolve in another, and the possibility of consensus or closure is always deferred. The question of whether any underlying essence or invariant structure anchors these shifting enactments remains open, as does the possibility that \u201cthe system\u201d is nothing more\u2014and nothing less\u2014than the temporary, negotiated product of these intersecting practices."
