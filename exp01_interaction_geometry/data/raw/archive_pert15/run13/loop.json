The act of naming or partitioning a system as \u201ccomplex\u201d can itself generate new boundaries, relations, or phenomena, which may or may not persist or stabilize over time. Each interpretive move\u2014whether it emphasizes interconnection, hierarchy, unpredictability, or some other feature\u2014does not merely reflect a pre-existing reality but participates in the ongoing constitution and differentiation of the system as an object of knowledge, policy, or practice. The performative effects of such moves might be fleeting, recursive, or accumulate in unpredictable ways, and the criteria for what \u201ccounts\u201d as a system, a component, or a relation may shift as interpretive acts proliferate or fade. Uncertainty inheres not only in what can be known or represented but in the effects of interpretation itself\u2014effects that may only become visible in hindsight, to some observers but not others, or may remain latent until activated by new interpretive or material conditions. The play of categorization, its iterative and distributed nature, and its entanglement with material, institutional, and discursive realities all contribute to an ongoing uncertainty about where systems begin and end, what makes them complex, and how interpretation participates in\u2014or escapes\u2014their becoming."
