In such a landscape, the very criteria for what it means to \u201cimprovise\u201d or \u201cattune\u201d remain open-ended, shaped by shifting demands, values, and the continual interplay between anticipation and surprise. The system\u2019s complexity is thus encountered not only as a problem to be solved, but as a condition to be inhabited\u2014one that continually unsettles the boundaries of knowledge, action, and identity."
