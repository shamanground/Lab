Institutional routines or technological infrastructures may stabilize certain forms of sense-making, yet these can be disrupted by crises, innovations, or shifts in collective attention, causing old opacities to resurface or new ones to emerge. The acts of naming, measuring, or modeling the system are entangled with negotiations over authority, legitimacy, and value, with different actors contesting not only what is or isn\u2019t understood but what should be. Opacity, in this context, is not only a residue of complexity but a dynamic element in the ongoing politics of interpretation, continually shaping and shaped by the partial, provisional, and often conflicting efforts to make sense of the system\u2019s unfolding present."
