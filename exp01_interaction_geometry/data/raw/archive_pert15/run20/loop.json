What is believed or assumed about the system may depend on trust, suspicion, or collective mood, and the boundary between fact and fabrication is often porous, unstable, or impossible to establish. The rumor may amplify, distort, or dissipate as it moves, and each retelling can alter both the substance and the stakes of what is \u201cknown.\u201d Interpretation, in this context, is provisional, opportunistic, and often recursive\u2014rumors about the system generate new rumors, and the act of interpretation itself feeds back into the circulation of uncertainty. The system, as rumor, is never entirely accessible or settled, always shifting as attention, interpretation, and circumstance change, leaving its reality in a state of ongoing negotiation and indeterminacy."
