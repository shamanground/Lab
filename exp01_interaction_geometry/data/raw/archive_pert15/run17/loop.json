The system could be experienced as a tangle of fast and slow processes, sudden shocks and gradual drifts, periodicities and one-off events, with no clear vantage point from which all temporal layers are equally visible or significant. What appears urgent or decisive at one timescale may be negligible or invisible at another, and causal relations may stretch or compress depending on which temporal frame is chosen. The observer\u2019s own temporal orientation\u2014impatience, nostalgia, anticipation\u2014might shape what is noticed, valued, or dismissed as noise. Attempts to synchronize or harmonize these temporalities might founder, revealing lags, feedbacks, or path dependencies that resist integration. The boundaries between past, present, and future could blur, with memory and expectation folding into perception and action in unpredictable ways. Whether the system\u2019s complexity inheres in its multiplicity of times, in the observer\u2019s shifting attention, or in some interaction between the two may remain permanently unsettled, with every temporal map provisional and every temporal cut risking new forms of blindness."
