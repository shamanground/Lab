The relation between the term and any \u201creal\u201d referent remains fragile and reversible; the gap between what is invoked and what is grasped persists, sometimes narrowing, sometimes widening, but never entirely closed. Whether the invocation of \u201ccomplex system\u201d ultimately clarifies, complicates, or destabilizes the situation cannot be settled in advance and may itself become a point of negotiation, contestation, or creative departure. Even the impulse to expand, elaborate, or specify what is meant by \u201ccomplex system\u201d risks generating further ambiguities, suggesting that the term\u2019s most enduring quality is its capacity to sustain, rather than resolve, uncertainty."

Each time the phrase is invoked, it may both gesture toward the unsayable and reshape what is considered unsayable, producing new configurations of visibility and obscurity, urgency and hesitation. The invocation might crystallize fleeting alliances between disciplines, methods, or communities, but these alliances could dissolve or mutate as priorities, vocabularies, or conceptual habits shift. \u201cComplex system\u201d might signal the promise of synthesis or the impossibility of synthesis, serve as an engine for interdisciplinary experimentation or as a placeholder for irreconcilable multiplicity. Its boundaries may contract, expand, or fracture according to changing stakes, while its referent might remain virtual, deferred, or multiply instantiated across different sites of inquiry. The act of naming may open spaces for critique, creativity, or resistance, but also for confusion, misunderstanding, or strategic ambiguity. Whether the phrase ultimately anchors a research agenda, dissolves into methodological skepticism, or persists as a site of productive indeterminacy is not settled by its use; rather, each invocation reactivates the very uncertainties that sustain it, leaving open the possibility that \u201ccomplex system\u201d is less an object to be understood than a recurrent event in the ongoing negotiation of understanding itself."
